  <!-- 
    SVG Icon of a simple house using a thick lineart style.
    - Key elements: House shape, roof, door, and a chimney.
    - Style: Minimalist, thick outline, no fill, and no windows as requested.
    - Technique: Uses basic shapes (<rect> and <polyline>) grouped together.
    - A single <g> element is used to apply styling consistently across all parts.
    - stroke-linejoin="round" is used to create soft, friendly corners.
    - The stroke-width is set to 6 for a bold, "thick lineart" appearance.
